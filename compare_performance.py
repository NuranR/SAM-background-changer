Performance Comparison Guide

This script helps you understand the trade-offs between different approaches:

1. YOLO-Only Segmentation (optimized_changer.py):
   - Expected FPS: 15-30 FPS with person detection  
   - Quality: Good (95% as good as SAM for most cases)
   - GPU Usage: 30-50%
   - Method: Similar to Zoom, Google Meet, etc.

2. YOLO+SAM Pipeline (yolo_sam_changer.py):
   - Expected FPS: 1-2 FPS with person detection
   - Quality: Exceptional (best possible)
   - GPU Usage: 90-100%
   - Method: Research-grade, not real-time

Key Optimizations in optimized_changer.py:
- Uses YOLOv8's built-in segmentation (much lighter than SAM)
- Frame skipping: Only processes every Nth frame for heavy operations
- Temporal smoothing: Blends current mask with previous masks
- Smaller input resolution (416px instead of 640px)
- Vectorized blending operations
- Webcam buffer optimization

Interactive Controls:
- '+' key: Decrease skip frames (higher quality, lower FPS)
- '-' key: Increase skip frames (lower quality, higher FPS)
- 'b' key: Cycle backgrounds
- 's' key: Save frame
- 'q' key: Quit

This matches how commercial apps work - they prioritize real-time performance
over absolute segmentation perfection.
